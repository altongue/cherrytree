# CherryTree

CherryTree is a "mindmapping" application that is meant to make brainstorming easier and more fun while also making it easier to visualize connections and patterns in ideas.

## Get up and running
Getting this up and running has been simplified to an essentially two step procedure:

1. Clone the repo to your machine
2. Start a PHP server in the repo: `php -S localhost:8000`
